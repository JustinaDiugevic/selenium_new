# 🕸️ Selenium Web Scraper for [Website Name or Category]

This project automates data collection from **e-commerce products** using **Selenium** in Python.

It demonstrates my ability to:
- Automate repetitive data collection tasks,
- Extract structured information from dynamic websites,
- Save results into a clean dataset ready for further analysis (e.g. Power BI, Excel, or Python).

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustinaDiugevic/selenium_new.git
   cd selenium_new
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the scraper

bash
Copy code
python src/scraper.py
Find your results

The collected data will be saved to:
data/example_output.csv

💡 Example Output
Product	Price	Rating	URL
Example Item	€29.99	⭐⭐⭐⭐	link
Sample Product	€19.99	⭐⭐⭐	link

(Replace this with a few real rows from your scraped data)

📊 Use Case
This scraper can be used to:

Collect product or listing data for market research,

Monitor price changes or availability,

Prepare structured datasets for data analysis or Power BI dashboards,

Automate manual data collection processes.

🧠 What I Learned
Configuring and running Selenium WebDriver efficiently,

Using XPath / CSS selectors to target dynamic page elements,

Handling delays, pop-ups, and lazy-loaded content,

Saving scraped data in CSV / Excel for analysis.

📸 Screenshots
Add screenshots here to make your project visually clear:

Screenshot of the target website (if allowed).

Example:

🧩 Next Steps / Possible Improvements
Add automatic scheduling (e.g., daily scraping using Cron / Task Scheduler),

Integrate email or Slack notifications when new data appears,

Add a Jupyter Notebook to explore the collected data visually.

💬 Case Study Example
“A client needed daily product price updates from several online stores.
I built this Selenium scraper that collects and saves all data automatically.
It reduced manual data entry time by over 90%, and the output was used in a Power BI dashboard for trend analysis.”
